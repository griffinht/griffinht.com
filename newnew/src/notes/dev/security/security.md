remember: do LESS security to be more secure!
minimize security, be more productive
use systems which are secure by default
everything else is noise!
the issue is the noise is fun
    its fun to set up ssl/tls scanners
    but its all just noise!

the best systems are the ones which don't need to be monitored!
    but its ok to monitor all the metrics
        the graphs can be neat!
    but try to have no alerts! or as few as possible!

deployment
    you can test all the things
    but quickly you are just testing true=true
    so prioritize on things that actually break in production! and what better way than deploying literally always!
    this will break the things you actually change the most frequently!
        and also automate updates!
            just unpin and watchtower?
            proper way is commit bot but whatever.. those are unrelated i feel like

monitoring/alerting uptime
    the best monitoring/alerting is the one that doesn't have to happen!

cron
    if the job ran then idk bruh

backups
    if the backup succeeeded then you backed up
