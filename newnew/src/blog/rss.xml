<description><![CDATA[<p>adanh/webhook too limiting! i can’t even pass
binary files - only json or multipart form encoded :( and the config is
annoying and bulky i want to run sh -c ‘echo hello world’ which looks
like If I wanted to write a hook which ran
<code>sh -c 'echo hello world'</code>, then the config would look like
this!</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode yaml"><code class="sourceCode yaml"></code></pre></div>
<p>This is way too verbose</p>
<p>Given these limitations I decided to write my own tool - a tool which
could convert http requests to shell scripts! I even came up with a
name, http2shell, but realized it sounded too much like a tool for
HTTP/2 todo link to http2. Thus shell2http was born!</p>
<p>This tool would also be able to do what I have been trying to
implement for a while - a tool to run a build script when a URL is
visited, useful for frontend development. This feature already exists
for various tools - Hugo, react, blah blah blah, but I wanted it for all
tools!</p>
<p>wrote my own - what to call it? shell2http! i could build a reverse
proxy with curl!</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
class="sourceCode yaml"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">proxy</span><span class="kw">:</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">    </span><span class="fu">catch-all</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> </span><span class="ch">true</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="at">    </span><span class="fu">command</span><span class="kw">:</span><span class="at"> curl</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>As it turns out, <code>shell2http</code> already exists! Here is the
GitHub page - check out some of the <a
href="https://github.com/msoap/shell2http#examples">examples</a>!</p>
<p>I also noticed this tool supports CGI scripts
https://github.com/msoap/shell2http</p>
<p>cgi scripts - this is exactly what i need! and is built in to
python!!!</p>]]></description>
