Let's say we wanted to create a Docker image of iperf3, a piece of software used for measuring network bandwidth.

```
$ guix pack -f docker iperf
/gnu/store/i52pwyicnlwqla79ddsdrq18imb5lfwl-iperf-docker-pack.tar
$ docker load < /gnu/store/i52pwyicnlwqla79ddsdrq18imb5lfwl-iperf-docker-pack.tar
Loaded image: localhost/iperf:latest
$ docker run --rm -it localhost/iperf:latest
docker: Error response from daemon: container create: no command or entrypoint provided, and no CMD or ENTRYPOINT from image.
See 'docker run --help'.
```

However, by default `guix pack` will attempt to compress the resulting docker tarball using `gzip`, which I have found can be very slow! For development purposes, consider adding the `--compression=none` option to drastically speed up the build time.

docker load < 'pack'
Error response from daemon: failed to load image: payload does not match any of the supported image formats:
 * oci: initializing source oci:/var/tmp/api_load.tar2152152783:: open /var/tmp/api_load.tar2152152783/index.json: not a directory

Docker and podman issue lol
unable to upgrade to tcp, received 409



```
$ docker load < "$(guix pack -f docker --entry-point=iperf3)"
Loaded image: localhost/iperf:latest
$ docker run --rm -it localhost/iperf:latest
Error: crun: executable file `/gnu/store/jsb93bl1x6xr6n1by7gs69ja0yi307h0-profile/iperf3` not found in $PATH: No such file or directory: OCI runtime attempted to invoke a command that was not found
```

```
$ guix shell iperf -- which iperf3
/gnu/store/jsb93bl1x6xr6n1by7gs69ja0yi307h0-profile/bin/iperf3
```



--entry-point=/bin/iperf3


How can I use the other Dockerfile directives? (`CMD`, `EXPOSE`, `VOLUME`, ...) idk lol
How can I `ADD` or `COPY`?? good question todo
- make a guix package

```
FROM alpine

RUN apk add --no-cache iperf

ENTRYPOINT ["iperf3"]
```

```
FROM debian:bullseye-slim as build

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y iperf3 && apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

ENTRYPOINT ["iperf3"]
```

debian                           bullseye-slim     803d805eb2ce   6 days ago      84MB
alpine                           latest            c1aabb73d233   7 weeks ago     7.63MB
localhost/iperf                  latest            00b09fa62bbb   53 years ago    81.2MB

Note the creation date of `localhost/iperf`, the image from `guix pack`. It's 53 years old! Those familiar with reproducible builds will understand - the bit for bit something something todo
