my top apps are iMessage, notes, weather, mail, clock, maps, calendar, my bank app
my most used apps by screen time are safari, messages, notes, spotify, calendar, weather, clock, settings, find my, phone, snikket, discord, and my banking app

the only non apple apps there are spotify, snikket, and discord
    spotify
        its my most heavily used proprietary service (i think?)
            what are the alternatives?
                apple music 
    snikket
        I use jmp.chat as a second number which I can use to place/recieve calls and texts from my phone and computer via XMPP. Neat! they also run my own personal snikket instance for free, which i the desktop clients
    discord
        the discord web app sucks on mobile and its nice to have my communication apps work on my phone for the occasional message to a friend
            todo fix push?
        on desktop it is as nice as the windows desktop version (no reason to install desktop version)
    banking app
        zelle doesn't work on mobile for no reason :( (thanks schwab)
        mobile check deposit

i also have teams, zoom, and webex
    once i tried joining a an internship interview from my frankendebian system (debian with guix, with sway and firefox (and xdg-desktop-portal and xdg-desktop-portal-wlr with guix but debian dbus) and none of the video was working, and the pp would crash regularly
        turns out it was because i had to turn on the open source? cisco  hardware acceleration codec or something. thanks to microsoft teams for not documenting this at all, and thanks to cisco for doing it
    anyways i downloaded teams from the app store as quickly as i could and was able to salvage the interview and conduct it from my phone. the interview went fine, but they wound up rejecting me

    but thats why i have those apps - in case i need to make a video call, i need it to always work even if linux doesnt
