products vs tools

products: solutions to a problem
    can be sold
    can be marketed

tools: helps solve a problem
    can be sold, indirectly
    the best tools have no marketing
        toothbrush? text editor? dish towel?

some people build products
i want to make tools





salespeople/marketers
    salespeople make their own problems
    always yelling about every little thing
    what does a marketer do? sell you problems

builders
    builders make their own tools
    builders are too busy building to tell others
