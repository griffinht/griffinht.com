next iteration?

apple intelligence seems cool

not interested in an android, since iPhone has been keeping me happy

linux phones will probably never happen, and will probably always be several years worse than their iPhone and Android counterparts

# Web stuff

# Search engine

I am playing around with Kagi Search, Perplexity, and Google. I've also used SearxNG, but found it was usually too slow.

## finding stuff from real people

`site:reddit.com` helps me find product reviews and opinions from usually helpful internet strangers

`site:news.ycombinator.com` shows me deeper discussions related to tech

[Marginalia Search](https://search.marginalia.nu) has led to me discovering some amazing blogs and tutorials written by real people. Compare [marginalia](https://search.marginalia.nu/search?query=kubernetes) with [google](https://www.google.com/search?q=kubernetes).

I'm still looking for a better way to find curated content from people like me.

It's also worth checking out [Dan Luu's writeup on search engines](https://danluu.com/seo-spam/).

# RSS Reader

I use Miniflux. I love the integrations and power, and the UI is alright. It allows me to use native apps like Feedly On my iPhone has a slick interface for consuming my feeds via the API.

# Password manager
I use Bitwarden. It does a decent job of integrating with all my devices.

# Code editor

Neovim
I love modal editing, and will seek vim keybindings in every program I use from now on. However, I have spent far far too long wrangling editor configurations. Modern developer tools aren't mature enough to be distributed by your favorite package manager, which leaves us poor end users stuck with gluing together extracted VSCode language servers and broken Node/python programs.

# Shell

Fish has nice autocompletions. I could use zsh, but fish seems to have most things I want built in.

# File browser
