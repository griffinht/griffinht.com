Misc


> I want to access network resources from any personal device or machine

> I want to connect/disconnect devices to my network without worrying about key generation

[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) is the obvious choice here. Wireguard feels like the best VPN protocol, and Tailscale seems to wrap thsi perfectly. I like todo link blog post from founder

[Hetzner Cloud](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/) is cheap and cozy, unlike AWS and GCP. The UI is also extremely fast - spinning up a VM, renaming it, editing it, and everything else feels very fast.

[PikaPods](https://www.pikapods.com/pods)
I've been trying out [Paperless-ngx](https://paperless-ngx.com/) and [Changedetection](https://changedetection.io/)


Files

> I want to be able to sync files and documents (PDFs, spreadsheets, plain text stuff, etc.) between my iPhone, Macbook, and Linux desktop

> I also want my files to be backed up, with recovery mechanisms in case things get deleted

> I also want to be able to send/receive/share files with friends/family - Google Drive is the clear winner here

Google Drive/syncthing todo?


Photos

> I want to automatically back up photos from my iPhone

> I want to access my photos from any device

Google Photos
It's better than iCloud
I don't know of many alternatives which aren't self hosted

Email

> I want to send/receive mail from any device using native clients (like Mail for Apple devices)

> I want to receive use my own domain (griffinht.com) and have a catch-all

> No need for push notifications!

Gmail + [Forward Email](https://forwardemail.net/en)

Google Workspace $6/mo

Constraints

- Not google - I think it would be a fun challenge to not use a big email provider

> Not google





## Tech stuff

Git

[Github](https://github.com/griffinht)
I'm interested in sourcehut, but value the search engine rankings of Github. I want people to be able to search my projects in a search engine and instantly find the source code.

DNS

CDN

Web host

My website is a [static site](https://indieweb.org/static_site) which I host using [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)


Domain Registrar

I wanted to find a registrar which was independent from Since I already use Cloudflare for my DNS/CDN services, I wanted to try

In the past I used [Google Domains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Domains), which was fine until I wanted to degoogle.
