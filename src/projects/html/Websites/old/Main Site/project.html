    <h2 class="title">Fakevirus</h2>
    <p class="content">Fakevirus is a fake virus I created. Once executed, this will split into 3 files. These files will copy themselves to the newly created directory in the Roaming folder (type into the start menu %appdata% and press enter) called fakevirus. After this, the actual virus is started. First, a series of prompts displays. After this, fakevirus shuts down your computer in about 1 minute. This can be aborted with a file in the administator version. Enjoy!</p>
