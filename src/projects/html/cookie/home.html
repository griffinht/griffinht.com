	<p>Welcome! This website has a bunch of random things on it. I coded it by myself. That is why you dont see the usual background or other parts. You will find my software on this site like <a id="fakevirus" href="fake.html">fakevirus </a>which is, as the name suggests, a fake virus! Took a while to make. Please check it out. There are also links to my Minecraft <a id="serstat" href="serverstat.html">server statuses</a> which I refuse to update. This has no ads, and, its not online 24 hours a day! Enjoy!</p>
