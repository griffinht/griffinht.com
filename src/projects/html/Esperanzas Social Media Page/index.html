    <div id="subtitle">My Story</div>
    <p>I used to be a rich and spoiled young girl. I thought nothing could ever change and I would always be rich with my loving family. That all changed when a group of people who hated rich people like Papa who owned a lot of land, killed him. They didn't know Papa was always giving his land away to his servants. They thought he was just another greedy and rich person. After that, things just went wrong, very wrong. My evil uncles burned down our house and vineyard. We had no way of getting any money to support us. We had to sleep in the servant's small houses. We finally decided to go to the United States of America. It was very hard to get through immigration and the train ride was disgusting. When we finally got there, we found the cabins to be very small. I described it as a "horse stall". I made a friend named Isabel. She is a very nice and cheerful girl. Mama got sick from Valley Fever, a sickness caused by dust getting into your lungs. I thought Mama would never get better and die like Papa. She was grieving for Abuelita. Mama really wanted Abuelita with her. I started saving my money I worked for to try to someday bring back Abuelita. When Mama was well enough to return to the camp, I decided to show her the money I had been saving up. When I looked into the valise, it was gone, every cent of it. Miguel took the money orders with him. I was so upset and mad at him at first, until I found out that he used the money to bring back someone. I was brought to a bus station and saw a bus. Miguel stepped off first, then a frail old lady stepped off after him. It took me a bit to recognize who it was. It was Abuelita! I was so happy! We brought her back to the camp and introduced her to everyone. After that, everyone was happy, again. My story is a sad and happy one. I had a rough life, but in the end, things turned out just fine.</p>
