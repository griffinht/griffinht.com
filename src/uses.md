# Web stuff

## Web Browser
I use Firefox because it isn't Chrome. The dev tools also usually feel better than Chrome.

# Ad blocker
The only correct option here is uBlock Orgin.

# Search engine
I use a self hosted instance searxng for general Internet searching.

I have tried using AI search engines like Perplexity or that kagi one but they have never stuck for me. I'm probably using them wrong or something idk.

For when I want to see content from (usually) real people, I add `site:reddit.com`. When I want to see deep technical discussions on a topic, I add `site:news.ycombinator.com`. I'm looking for more sites to filter by, but Reddit and Hacker News have covered all my bases.

I use [Marginialia Search](https://search.marginalia.nu/) when I am exploring new topics. Marginalia shows me incredibily valuable blog posts from real humans just like me.

# RSS Reader
I use Miniflux. I love the integrations and power, and the UI is alright. On my iPhone, I use the native Feedly app, which provides a slick interface for consuming my feeds via the Miniflux API.

# Email client
I use `aerc` and Thunderbird. Thunderbird often hurts to use, but . `aerc` is often a pleasure to use, even if it can be too minimal at times. Maybe I will look for other mail clients, but for now, `aerc` is fine.

# Window manager

I use `sway`, a tiling window manager for Wayland. I'm 

# Password manager
I use Bitwarden. It is FOSS and integrates with my web browser and my iPhone, and I can self host it using Vaultwarden for free!




# Code editor

Notepad++
Notepad on Windows sucks. Notepad++ is better. It occupies the same space in my heart as the legendary WinRAR.
Great for HTML/JavaScript development. I used it for Node. Check out my ball game! todo add ball game

IntelliJ Idea
Great for Java development. IntelliJ basically taught me java with its superb code suggestions. It felt like the best last generation IDE I've used so far.

Neovim
I love modal editing, and will seek vim keybindings in every program I use from now on. However, I have spent far far too long wrangling editor configurations. Modern developer tools aren't mature enough to be distributed by your favorite package manager, which leaves us poor end users stuck with gluing together extracted VSCode language servers and broken Node/python programs.

VSCode
I have resisted VSCode for far too long. I think I remember it was a weird lightweight e

These days I am realizing it is the de facto editor and will be for a long long time. I think it is incredible how VSCode has freed developers from the language specific heavyweights such as IntelliJ or Eclipse. The best part about VSCode is power users like me can use it 

VSCode is still slow. But there is nothing in the world that compares to the developer experience. Opening a Jupyter notebook and I get prompted to install all the extensions I need - and they just work. When the best developer tools target the same platform, I don't need to get in the crossfire of integration like I do with Neovim plugins.

# Terminal

I use `foot`. It works nicely and is minimal.

# Interactive Shell

Fish has nice autocompletions. I could use zsh, but fish seems to have most things I want built in.

VSCode
It sucks. If I have to use VSCode for browsing files, then I am doing something wrong. Check out how I minfied my VSCode todo

nnn
I use `nnn` at work right now because I feel like I have gotten too comfortable with `lf` and wanted to try something different. My first impressions are that `nnn` has , and I don't like it. It has tabs. I'm sure these can be disabled, but it still

Any time I see software with tabs I become immediately grossed out and suspicious. I have solved tabs and windows since using my tiling window manager

On my phone this is fine but still
