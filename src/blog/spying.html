Spying on my users with a GET request

lemonpickles.net/generator provides a simple and poorly made way to create large, graphic text in Minecraft chat. See the example here. The tool was originally hosted at https://lemonpickles.net/generator, and made public by the reddit post https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/6bznqx/remember_111_chat_limit_is_op_i_made_a_copypaste/. 

The tool was originally hosted with a free plan from https://www.freehostia.com/ because it was the only free hosting option I knew of (I never looked very hard). I also used Cloudflare for DNS and proxy, and after a monthly email total noticed my website had a decent bit of unique visitors and traffic. This made me curious to know how popular my little website really was. All I really wanted to know was how many real users I had, so I used the only analytics tool I knew of - Google Analyitics. This is what I used for years, but I eventually began to despire it. Using Google Analytics was hypocrtical - I even blocked it with my own ad blocker (uBlock Origin). All I wanted was to see how many users I had, not feed big tech, 

Eventually I moved the site to Cloudflare Pages and removed the tracking script, I also  but then I did not know how many users I had! 

Eventually I moved to self hosting
