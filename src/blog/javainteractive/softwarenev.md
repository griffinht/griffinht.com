# A personal computing history

ok this has gone off the rails lmao

Specifically, a personal history of interactions with computers.

# 2007? The beginning

idk if this counts?

prek tots for kids got me in to computer games i think. I would be sit in the hallway with the person (lady? tutor? instructor) on a laptop (todo insert image approximation) (with a CDROM drive) and play computer games. This was where I was introduced to a few different CDROM games. My favorites included [Wild Wheels](https://archive.org/details/wild-wheels-pc), inventive machine crazy machine? (was it?) and [Speedy Eggbert](https://www.blupi.org/) (now open source)!

I distinctly a time while playing Wild Wheels, where I was driving around a world with mountains and lava, and managed to take a brief dip in the lava. This caused my wheels to pop in the game

Wild Wheels had destruction physics and effects! Parts would fly off the vehicle everytime it collided with a wall, and sparks would fly while scraping across metal.

school computer lab
    these machines were running windows XP, with a small subset running Windows 7. We sat according to our last name, and the beginning of the alphabet got upgraded to windows 7.
    elementary school - outlook/ ms online
        i remember that the command prompt was disabled, but i could bypass the restricition by writing a `.BAT` batch script in notepad, then running it.
            this allowed me to CD and DIR around the computer. i even found the users directory \\Users? which showed me a list of every student who had logged in to that machine - i felt like such a hacker!
            this was also the time of using an easily guesssable incrementing student id, and student ids were everyones password
                the first 4 digits of most people in our class was `1203` or `1204`, and the last 4 digits were public as part of everyone's email
        computer carts, first 10 minutes of class to log in to windows
    middle school - google drive
        chromebook era, instant login, google drive - no more files lost on the desktop (no matter how many times the technology teacher told us to use our network drives)
        covid then bring your own laptop (or take home chromebook), google drive
        google drive brought the source:domain trick, allowing me to browse every publicly shared document across the district - neat! if your org uses google drive, consider adding source:domain to the search bar, it seems to be seldom disabled

minecraft server 4th grade, skype with friends
    the first version of minecraft i played was 1.4.5. i remember the first thing i did was hop in to create and find a mineshaft - amazing!
        cue endless summer nights of c418 and chill - mining and crafting the summer nights away (link to mc music)
    this began my career of system administration
    My friends and I talked to each other after school on Skype, where we would find Minecraft servers to play on together. Favorites included the giants like Hypixel (still going strong), shotbow networks for minez, cubecraft?, and a bit of mineplex. We would also frequent smaller servers, craving the survival multiplayer experience. We mostly and a1craft (ecocraft?), the og prison server (a1?? see ssundee), towny? what early towny did i dO? YouTubers were a huge influence on how I played Minecraft - EthosCraft was probably my favotite. paulsoresjr taught me how to play, and og redstoners?

I remember how everyone was so impressed (including myself) that I had built an entire computer. All I had done was insert some components and plug in a few cables. This allowed me to finally run Minecraft at blazing fast speeds on my GTX 950 graphics card. The Minecraft server hosting continued and from 6th to 7th grade I ran DreadedMC todo web archive?, wh. This was when I went pro, going from server hosting on



The family computer was my first foray in to the magical digital world. It ran Windows XP, with the green start menu button. This was when I watched shows like [Cyberchase](link to youtube vid) on PBS kids with the ol' tube TV (my family's first flatscreen TV was an LED model around 2010, skipping the plasma era and going straight to RGB?).I enjoyed playing CDROM games rented from the library, and flash games on the web.

# The earliest days

The first programming I remember doing was a bit of JavaScript around 4th grade. I wanted to learn to code for some reason - why did I want to learn to code?

I probably fired up the ol' internet explorer? was i using chrome at the time

Neovim or NeoVim
eclipse (old)
intellij (proprietary improved eclipse)

I used to be an Intellij - it provided the best IDE experience I ever had. I used Eclipse beforehand and always thought of it as a clunky 2000s era relic of the past. IntelliJ blew me away with Intellisense. To clarify, my development had been the default notes, then Notepad++ (I thought it had good syntax highlighting, and multiple tabs were nice). Eclipse's tab management was annoying

Now I manage my "tabs" with my tiling window manager. Any app. I remember when Chrome's tab groups came out, and I thought they were such a great way to organize my pesky tabs. Now I barely use tabs in my browser, and instead try to keep one tab per window. This is the same with my text editor.

If I wanted to manage my Intellij or Eclipse (or VSCode) buffers with my window manager, then I couldn't! Even NeoVim, which seems to have excellent window management, I still try to keep one split open at a time, and may have several instances. This has been a struggle with Language Server integrations, where I might have several servers fr the same project running at once. This is not efficient and can break many servers. Additionally, each time I open a file I have to wait for the language server to start up. I am looking to be able to configure Neovim to use one language server per project, and reuse the language server from multiple NeoVim clients. todo

The other issue I have is editing the same file from two different editors. I often see the "you already have this file open in a different instance" warning and will then have to find the instance or blah. This is an issue when I am using language server code navigation, and want to jump to the definition of a function which is definined in a different file already open in a different NeoVim instance.


# tabs todo split to other article
Anyways any app that attempts to . I sometimes see new "web browsers" (chrome/chromoum/todo wrappers) which aim to reimagine the browsing experience by implementing some form of advanced

I also stopped using dual or even triple monitors after my 

I began using dual monitors a while ago for gaming, which allowed me to have the game on one screen and Discord or a web browser with a map or a wiki page pulled up for reference. I then extended this for work - I could have my text editor on one screen with a document on the other, saving me from having to switch between the two. Technically, I could have simply 

IDEs are ginourmous space hogs. They always needed an entire rectangular screen, and would become unusable if given less space

show example of full screen vs half screen eclipse/intellij

This made me realize how useful a dual monitor setup could be with programming - IDE on one screen, reference document (web search, documentation, code snippets) on the other. todo use regular language like google and stackoverflow and more recently ChatGPT.

# Spring 2023
    
    more guix, more sway, more neovim, more lf, no ides

316 and 230

I started using NeoVim for simple text editing only. I knew there were ways to make it more useful for "real" programming 

NeoVim began as a better Notepad++ for me - the modal text editing was an improvement over the "regular" standard todo single mode editing provided by Notepad++. I liked the this way so much that I installed the Vim plugin in IntelliJ. I remember thinking how my programming 

NeoVim + IntelliJ with the vim plugin served me well for a while. I used NeoVim alongside `lf`, my terminal based file manager. This allowed me to browse files with my keyboard, then instantly e. This served my programming needs very well at the time. I was mostly programming school projects in Java and C. 

I was mostly experimenting with Docker at this time, managing my services todo link. This environment tended to have extremely long feedback loops - I would edit some kind of `.yml` or `Dockerfile` then run a command to rebuild or redeploy or re whatever my changes. Most of the work was reading documentation or configuring things. This meant the only needs I had for my developer tools were the ability to edit files, which were fulfilled completely with `lf` + NeoVim.

# Fall 2023

326 and 246

I eventually found my needs were shifting, and I began demanding more from my development environment. My university C programming classes fueled this need. I would see my classmates using VSCode to debug their C programs, just like I debugged my Java programs in IntelliJ. I had been getting by with good 'ol `gdb`, but wanted more. Code navigation, improved syntax highlighting, and an actual debugging environment were all things I was looking for. It wasn't until midway through my 3rd semester (Fall 2023) that I got these things working.

It started with language servers. The built in syntax highlighting for NeoVim was fine for certain things, but completely fell apart when compared to IntelliJ's Java syntax highlighting. This was mostly fine for a while, because I would simply use Eclipse for bruh [CSC 326](todo link) had me writing a Java program. The 

This was also the time that I had had enough with Eclipse. 

I never saw C as a language which required all the . I got used to the edit-save-compile workflow, with a shell REPL in one


it could be more useful Once I configured using NeoVim for "real" programming (programming which requires "intellisense" and debugging)
