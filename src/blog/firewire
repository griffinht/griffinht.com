After doing some research, I realized I would need a firewire card that would be installed to a PCIe lane in my desktop. 

Using the original camcorder allows for maximum quality.

Touchscreen broke, USB transfer doesn't work.

echo -1 > a random file for debug info
dmesg --follow for debug info
card doesnt even fit in pci slot

Original firewire card did not work

Why pay some person to do it?
