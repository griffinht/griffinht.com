# goals

## docker daemon

set up a docker daemon which I can access remotely via ssh. For example:

```
DOCKER_HOST=shh?/todo
```

## volumes

I'd like to access the volume array on my [hypervisor](todo link), and use it to provide persistent storage for my containers.

## networking

I'd like for my containers to be able to talk to each other, and I'd like to expose my containers to the internet
todo rewrite that


# operating system
