this makes it fairly easy to write some integration tests if you wanted to - nginx example!!!! or maybe python simple se
rvice type?!?                                                                                                           
todo mention other tools for unit testing vm images??                                                                   
                                                                                                                        
publish the rocker image!!!! and vm image!!!                                                                            
                                                                                                                        
thanks to us declaring our operating system as guile code, we can trivially make the fields customizable                
                                                                                                                        
here we are making a dummy ssh key, which we can use to make sure we can log in                                         
                                                                                                                        
this is where a tooo like ansible would normally take over to set up various ssh keys and user accounts or maybe pressed
 or cloud unit                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                        
the other (better) option is to simply generate the actual disk image and skip the install process                      
                                                                                                                        
now that we have our disk image, the next step is to copy it to the physical machine                                    
                                                                                                                        
the easiest way for me is to plug in the ssd via a usb data adapter and cp                                              
                                                                                                                        
neat trick: if the ssd has an existing operating system installed, we can boot to it with army -hda cool!               
another way would be to grab any old “live cd”, copy it to a thumb drive, boot to the thumb drive, and use the live syst
em to copy the image to the drive over the network                                                                      
                                                                                                                        
this trchnique also works great for installing any operating system on a cloud vpses, see here to see how i did it with 
my racknerd vps                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                        
ssh guix guix update                                                                                                    
but guix has a better way                                                                                               
guix deploy                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                        
this also has limited support for cloud environments - digital ocean
