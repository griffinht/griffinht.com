do a big comparison of alternatives
guix should basically reduce all of them to nothing!

guix deploy for local vms!
guix deploy for system.scm!
guix deploy for everything!!!
guix deploy for qemu!


(qemu?
(libvirt
 (uri "ssh://")

deploy non guix? these should apply to any image in many cases...)
(solusvm

(guix-system-image-vm
(guix-system-docker
(guix-system-container
(guix-system-vm
 (system system.scm)
