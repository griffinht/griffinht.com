most git servers are complicated 

i wanted to self host my git repositories, and i wanted to avoid the "do it all" git servers

read only access via my website and `git clone`
read+write via private file server

clone all of your github directories to working directory

replace $USER with your github user
requires `curl jq git`
`curl https://api.github.com/users/"$USER"/repos | jq -r '.[].html_url' | while read -r url; do git clone --bare "$url"; done`

create new repository
`git init --bare $NAME`
