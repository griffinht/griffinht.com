# CARRIER LOOKUPS
https://freecarrierlookup.com/


snikket kind of works with sure.im
macaw.me
other providers don't work

every single client and server partially work with each other
every client is buggy


the happy path
jmp chatterbox.town or sure.im
then you are done

why do certain devices get certain messages but frequently they also dont?

Wi-Fi Calling cannot be turned on and off at will. Instead, you can enable Wi-Fi calling in Settings>Wi-Fi Calling>On. You may need to enter your emergency address. This is the address that will be automatically sent to emergency services like 911 (todo check if other countries)
Why can't I Wi-Fi call on my computer?
    what if the computer has a sim??? todo search putting sims/esims in computers
    If Wi-Fi calling needs a sim (what is a sim? cellular connection?), then why can't we place calls from a regular computer with an Internet connection?

    Microsoft Windows with the app (todo) and Apple from a macbook can place wifi calls (and regular?) from the computer by connecting to the phone when it is nearby via bluetooth and placingn the call on the phone, from the computer (what?? reword). This only works when the phone is close to the computer. The computer is simply acting as a remote control, and is not actually able to place Wi-Fi calls.

How can I turn on Wi-Fi Calling?
    Wi-Fi calling should be an option which can be turned on in your phone's cellular settings.
https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iph78f4697ca/ios
    If you have an iPhone, 
        1. go to Settings> Cellular
        2. If you have Dual SIM, find the "SIMs" subsection and choose a line. You should choose the line which has the number which you would like to use Wi-Fi calling from.
How can I use Wi-Fi Calling?

When does my phone use Wi-Fi Calling?
    Your phone will use Wi-Fi calling when

    - How can I connect my phone to the Internet in airplane mode?

iphone how to turn off data
if you have 1 sim (the regular thing most people have0
data roaming off - your phone (probably) will not use data over your celluar connection
    note you cannot prevent it from roaming
airplain mode
    you will lose your ability to talk, text, data
    however you can connect to wifi and turn on wifi calling then you can talk, text unlimited no international depends on your carrier
        remember wifi calling in europe is the same as wifi calling in the us, thus you will not be charged for internatoin
removing the physical sim
    you will lose your ability to wifi call
    maybe a table is helpful

if oyu have 2 sims (or 1 esim???) your phone enters a super secret mode that is extra confusing
