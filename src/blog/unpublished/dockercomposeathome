microservices code level api contract
unit tests, then shouldnt need to test together because they should just work


other services - ldap to nginx http auth blah blah
a little harder to unit test by themselves, mocking up a service would be too difficult
we need to test the services together
called integration tests?

use docker compose for defining our tests!
