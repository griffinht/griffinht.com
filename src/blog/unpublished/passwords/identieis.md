password - only you have it until you share it or the service has it
password - could be easily guessable then others have it as well

password derivation functions whatever those are called - bcrypt

if you have to roll your own - if you are asking  yourself questinos about salt + pepper then its time to not roll your own!

            can get tiring to put in, tempts to write it down





a password is an identity
you are an identity
