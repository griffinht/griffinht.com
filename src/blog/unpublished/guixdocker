coreos sucks - see how to enable systemd unit on boot
debian is fine - standard unix experience, conigure with ansible

how can i test coreos? every time i have to deploy to a real system?
    - i have to test with qemu? so fat!
    - https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-coreos/provisioning-qemu/

how can i manage my machine's config? and keep it up to date? guix!
how do i change a simple config without reprovisioning the entire machine? guix!

https://stumbles.id.au/getting-started-with-guix-deploy.html

https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Invoking-guix-system.html
we can make a basic guix image by defining a simple operating system then first test this as a lightweight docker container! or qemu or whatver its just a system image
then we deploy ONCE not everytime we change a config as we would with immutable coreos
then we use guix deploy to manage the config - no more entire redeploys! we can change everything! 100% rollback!



testing with docker
not quite because some weird networking issues todo basically i can't get herd services loopback or networking which ssh-daemon depends on because of a netlink error or something probably becaus of docker networking and thanks to me using podman

rootless fake docker with podman
    networking fails
    loopback fails
hot-desktop real docker
    networking starts, loopback does't same error

potentially related to ? https://issues.guix.gnu.org/issue/34333
