Spying on my users with a GET request

lemonpickles.net/generator provides a simple and poorly made way to create large, graphic text in Minecraft chat. See the example here. The tool was originally hosted at https://lemonpickles.net/generator, and made public by the reddit post https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/6bznqx/remember_111_chat_limit_is_op_i_made_a_copypaste/. 

The tool was originally hosted with a free plan from https://www.freehostia.com/ because it was the only free hosting option I knew of (I never looked very hard). I also used Cloudflare for DNS and proxy, and after a monthly email total noticed my website had a decent bit of unique visitors and traffic. This made me curious to know how popular my little website really was. All I really wanted to know was how many real users I had, so I used the only analytics tool I knew of - Google Analyitics. This is what I used for years, but I eventually began to despire it. Using Google Analytics was hypocrtical - I even blocked it with my own ad blocker (uBlock Origin). All I wanted was to see how many users I had, not feed big tech, 

Eventually I moved the site to Cloudflare Pages and removed the tracking script, but then I did not know how many users I had! 

Eventually I moved the site to hosted the site myself on my residential fiber connection with an nginx server, as seen at this repository https://github.com/stzups/hot. This let me view all the HTTP requests coming to the server. They looked something like this

127.0.0.1 - - [06/Feb/2022:04:39:14 +0000] "GET /path/to/resource HTTP/1.1" 200 357 "-" "user-agent"

What if I sent my own GET request and added some tracking info to the resource path? This approach would require no special server software. The only requirement was to be able to view the server logs, which I was able to now that I hosted my website by myself!

function submitTracking(value) {
    let request = new XMLHttpRequest();
    request.open("GET", "tracking/" + value);
    request.send();
}


submitTracking("referrer/"+document.referrer);

This way I not only get to see how many people visit my website, I also get to see how many people (and bots) execute the javascript. I also get to see where all my traffic comes from with window.referrer. 

I can even log all user input to the generator!

submitTracking("input/" + input.value);

This worked perfectly - viewing the tracking information was as simple as | grep tracking/input. I found many lewd and immature, as well as some other things

Now instead of big tech spying on my users, I get to spy on my users! My only regret is not doing this sooner.
