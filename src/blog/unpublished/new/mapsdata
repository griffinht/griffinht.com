the solution is hashmap
sql is slow use it as little and infrequently as possible
    what if i cached my data
    dont engineer your own datbase



the cogs in my programmer brain began to turn as i envisioned the pipeline i would create

i could create m threads and allocate n/m indices for each thread to compute and the results could be returned as a vector then i would combine each vector in to one big final result vector after waiting for each to join or maybe i could assign work as needed with producers and consumer sas i had done in my operating systems course with various ipc mechanisms and posix apis for pthreads.



here is some code i have written throughout the past few years
this is a map reduce
this is a map collect

these techinqures arent just for programs on your machine - they also work in distributed systems and databases!!!
