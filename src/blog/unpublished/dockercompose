Using docker compose the right way

Stop using docker-compose, use docker compose

Ssh access is easy

Bind mounts are useless
It is easy to view a docker volume from your host just docker volume inspect for mountpoint

.env for secrets, not secrets file (it is not moved wiih docker context)
use docker context


docker compose dev vs prod source ./production.env
