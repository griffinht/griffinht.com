I told myself I was going to get zero trust access set up first. I would **pick an identity provider** build my own identity provider, and configure Caddy. But I haven't gotten around to that. I did manage to spin up my services.

A home lab is just that - a lab for experimentation. Experiments have notebooks and are terribly. I always hear how horrifying the python scripts that researchers write are to "real" software devs like "us". But why not experiment? Why does everything have to be good? That's why a home lab is just that - a lab, a place for me to experiment. I regularly find random little things I want to do

A woodworker may have little projects they like to build, so . Half the fun for them is building their workshop in their shed. Same with a mechanic in a garage, a workout junkie in their home gym, and a chef in their kitchen. A software engineer like me? 

Why would a woodworker want to go to a shop to woodwork? A chef travelling to an industrial kitchen to cook their morning eggs? Industrial kitchens are ugly and don't look comfortable. What if I could build the comfiest coziest right in my home? Heck? why not use real industrial tools? Or the tools that the chef whishes they could use at work, but can't because of work. Work is the place to get things done, home is the place to explore and grow. Work is as well, but I don't see chefs experimenting a new pastry recipe when the line is running

It's such an obvious parallel but I feel like so many technology people don't have this space.

The welder may have welding stuff


The common feature out of all of these setups are 

I haven't been building anything. I have, but my servers are husks and I have no long running projects. Those are the most special, in my opinion. Software can be living and breathing, or it can be left dead and to rot. I want to revive all my old software projects and put them on display. Even if it is as simple as []. But to accomplish that I need to build my workshop - my lab.

My original home lab was just that - my home. In 6th grade I was the server guy for my friends - we wanted to play on our own Minecraft world with our own rules, and that meant running our own server. Queue all the "how to run your own minecraft server" and "how to port forward" YouTube videos. The LAN, a natural element

Non engineers have experienced the magic of the LAN, when they stream to music players and attach their NAS and have LAN parties and all their IOT gear.

There are so many shiny objects which get in the way. Zero trust! Observability! Services! Maintenence! Disks! Instances! VPSes! None of these things are related to the Minecraft server I want to rescuiciate.

But just put it on a VPS! This approach does not scale. I have the capacity to run a VPS. Maybe two or three if I really wanted to. But between maintenence and everything the VPS would just die. And why would I want to pay $5 a month for a whole VPS? I want to build a platform for the things I want to build.
