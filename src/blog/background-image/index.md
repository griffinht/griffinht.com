# hello

This background image is the result of some visual artififacts I encountered while playing BeamNG.Drive.
<img src="background.png">

After capturing this image, I editied in Paint.NET to create my own special wallpaper.
I have used this image as my desktop background for a few years now.
Now, it is available to everyone who visits this website.
