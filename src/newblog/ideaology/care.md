most people don't care

i dont know i 
personally i could care less about getting it done i want to figure out why firefox wont show the menu idk


i had a friend ask
afterwards, i felt like he was happy to have done a good job for his manager, who im sure was happy to see that his employee had come up with a good solution to the problem
i could care less whether the problem was solved or not. if the task was something more complex and i had done a bad job, then i still wouldn't care idk
