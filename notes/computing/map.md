You will not become a Linux expert, Docker expert, or a Kubernetes expert. I am none of those things - not even close!

You will not become a:
- Linux expert
- Docker expert
- Kubernetes export

You will become a:
- Automation expert
- GitOps expert

You will be able to deploy anything, anywhere, just like I have.

paas? fly.io?
cloud native? cloud managed resources?

You will however become fluent in everything. You will be able to see things that others do not.





cloud native VPS
a wise man on hacker news once said "you know there is a lot you can do on a $20 Hetzner machine"

And now, for my next trick, I shall create 5 more "Cloud VPSes".
That was easy!

Let's go cloud native, then back to bare metal


zero to vps
- not gonna do this one
zero to docker
- not gonna do this one
docker to guix/nix
- nix is a better docker registry than guix
docker to docker compose
- an aside on podman and rootlessness
docker compose to **production**
- apps: use a paas
- diy: use a vps
	- storage!
	- automation!
- container-container networking
docker compose to podman pods
- 
podman pods to kubernetes
- https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/01/29/podman-kubernetes-yaml
- kompose -> podman kube play
- podman kube play -> kind/minikube
docker compose -> kubernetes
- volumes -> configmaps
- auto deploy
kubernetes to **production**
- bruh
- idk! a new frontier!
- managed kube vs build your own
	- managed - i just got stuff to run
	- build your own
		- i wanna run it on my own hardware
		- wayyyyy cheaper
		- but always run the control plane on kube?
- fun fact: my app is multi cloud
- just kubectl context switch
- fun fact: this website is actually running in three different hyperscalers
docker stack???? docker swarm??
**hypervisor** to kubernetes **production**

vps = external dns
- look at me and my vpses


tailscale + app(s)
http proxy + http app(s)

note metrics and monitoring for load balancers!
