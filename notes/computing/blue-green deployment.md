[[deployment strategy]] 
the more complex the system, the less blue-green makes sense
https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html

compare to red/black deployment?



do the two environments persist or are they spun up on demand?


olden days:
we aren't gonna put twice the servers we need in our datacenter
we are just gonna ssh in and update live - maybe automate it with bash scripts

new days:
just make another cluster and boom




red/back blue/green is like the same



disaster recovery? failover?
